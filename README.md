<h1>fetch receipt processor</h1>

## About

This is my submission for the [Fetch receipt processor challenge](https://github.com/fetch-rewards/receipt-processor-challenge/).

## Summary of API Specification

### Endpoint: Process Receipts

- Path: `/receipts/process`
- Method: `POST`
- Payload: Receipt JSON
- Response: JSON containing an id for the receipt.

Description:

Takes in a JSON receipt (see example in the example directory) and returns a JSON object with an ID generated by your code.

Note: Data does not survive an application restart.

Example Response:

```json
{ "id": "7fb1377b-b223-49d9-a31a-5a02701dd310" }
```

## Endpoint: Get Points

- Path: `/receipts/{id}/points`
- Method: `GET`
- Response: A JSON object containing the number of points awarded.

A simple Getter endpoint that looks up the receipt by the ID and returns an object specifying the points awarded.

Example Response:

# Rules

These rules collectively define how many points should be awarded to a receipt.

- One point for every alphanumeric character in the retailer name.
- 50 points if the total is a round dollar amount with no cents.
- 25 points if the total is a multiple of `0.25`.
- 5 points for every two items on the receipt.
- If the trimmed length of the item description is a multiple of 3, multiply the price by `0.2` and round up to the nearest integer. The result is the number of points earned.
- 6 points if the day in the purchase date is odd.
- 10 points if the time of purchase is after 2:00pm and before 4:00pm.

## Examples

{
  "retailer": "Target",
  "purchaseDate": "2022-01-01",
  "purchaseTime": "13:01",
  "items": [

Total Points: 28
Breakdown:
     6 points - retailer name has 6 characters
    10 points - 4 items (2 pairs @ 5 points each)
     3 Points - "Emils Cheese Pizza" is 18 characters (a multiple of 3)
                item price of 12.25 * 0.2 = 2.45, rounded up is 3 points
     3 Points - "Klarbrunn 12-PK 12 FL OZ" is 24 characters (a multiple of 3)
                item price of 12.00 * 0.2 = 2.4, rounded up is 3 points

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started with Node

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download)

### Installation

Once Node.js and npm are installed,

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/haemie/fetch-receipt-processor.git
   ```
2. Navigate to project directory
   ```sh
   cd fetch-receipt-processor
   ```
3. Install NPM packages
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Transpile typescript files
   ```sh
   npm run tsc
   ```

### Usage

To start a local instance of the server:

```sh
npm start
```

When the terminal logs `receipt processor listening on port 3000`, the API is now listening for requests to http://localhost:3000.

### Testing

Unit tests can be ran using

```sh
npm run unit
```

With a server instance running, integration tests can be ran using:

```sh
npm run integration
```

Test requests are made to http://localhost:3000 by default.

## Getting Started with Docker

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

### Image Build

Once Docker is installed,

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/haemie/fetch-receipt-processor.git
   ```
2. Navigate to project directory
   ```sh
   cd fetch-receipt-processor
   ```
3. Build Docker image
   ```sh
   docker build -t receipt-processor .
   ```

### Usage

To start a Docker container with a running server in detached mode:

```sh
docker run -p 3000:3000 -d receipt-processor
```

The terminal will output the container ID
The API is now listening for requests to http://localhost:3000.

To stop the Docker container:

```sh
docker stop <container_ID>
```

### Testing

Unit tests are ran at build time.

## Accessing the API

With the server running on either a local instance of Node or through a running Docker container, the API can be accessed by making requests to http://localhost:3000.
